	abstract = {The emergence of wearable health sensors in the last decade has the potential to revolutionize the study of sleep and circadian rhythms. In particular, recent progress has been made in the use of mathematical models in the prediction of a patient’s internal circadian state using data measured by wearable devices. This is a vital step in our ability to identify optimal circadian timing for health interventions. We review the available data for fitting circadian phase models with a focus on wearable data sets. Finally, we review the current modeling paradigms and explore avenues for developing personalized parameter sets in limit cycle oscillator models to further improve prediction accuracy.},

Studying these systems may involve tracking the concentration of hundreds of variables in thousands of individual cells resulting in an extremely high-dimensional description of the system. However, for many of these systems the behaviors of interest occur on a collective or macroscopic scale. We define a new macroscopic reduction for networks of coupled oscillators motivated by an elegant structure we find in experimental measurements of circadian gene expression and several mathematical models for coupled biological oscillators. We characterize the emergence of this structure through a simple argument and demonstrate its applicability to stochastic and heterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. Finally, we perform the macroscopic reduction for the heterogeneous stochastic Kuramoto equation and compare the low-dimensional macroscopic model with numerical results from the high-dimensional microscopic model.},

Accurate predictive models for the human circadian light response have been used to study the impact of a host of light exposures on the circadian system. However, generally, these models do not account for the physiological basis of these rhythms. We illustrate a new paradigm for deriving models of the human circadian light response. Beginning from a high-dimensional model of the circadian neural network, we systematically derive low-dimensional models using an approach motivated by experimental measurements of circadian neurons. This systematic reduction allows for the variables and parameters of the derived model to be interpreted in a physiological context. We fit and validate the resulting models to a library of experimental measurements. Finally, we compare model predictions for experimental measurements of light levels and discuss the differences between our model's predictions and previous models. Our modeling paradigm allows for the integration of experimental measurements across the single-cell, tissue, and behavioral scales, thereby enabling the development of accurate low-dimensional models for human circadian rhythms.},

The present article explores an alternative explanation, the circadian clock, including the effects of circannual changes and social demands (i.e., social timing resulting from societal demands such as school or work schedules), and implications for seasonal patterns of weight gain. We provide a model for understanding the role circadian and circannual rhythms may play in the development of child obesity, a framework for examining the intersection of behavioral and biological causes of obesity, and encouragement for future research into bio-behavioral causes of obesity in children.},

While our current mathematical representation of the human circadian pacemaker has proven useful in many experimental situations, it uses as input only a direct effect of light on the circadian pacemaker. Although light (a photic stimulus) has been shown to be the primary synchronizer of the circadian pacemaker across a number of species, studies in both animals and humans have confirmed the existence of non-photic effects that also contribute to phase shifting and entrainment. We modified our light-based circadian mathematical model to reflect evidence from these studies that the sleep-wake cycle and/or associated behaviors have a non-photic effect on the circadian pacemaker. In our representation, the sleep-wake cycle and its associated behaviors provides a non-photic drive on the circadian pacemaker that acts both independently and concomitantly with light stimuli. Further experiments are required to validate fully our model and to understand the exact effect of the sleep-wake cycle as a non-photic stimulus for the human circadian pacemaker.},

We approached the analysis of the van der Pol oscillator-based model proposed by Kronauer and colleagues in 1999 and 2000 (Kronauer99) using a well-established framework from experimental psychology whereby the stimulus (S) acts on the organism (O) to produce a response (R). Within that framework, using four independent data sets utilizing calibrated personal light measurements, we conducted a serial analysis of the factors in the Kronauer99 model that could affect prediction accuracy characterized by changes in dim-light melatonin onset. Prediction uncertainty was slightly greater than 1 h for the new data sets using the original Kronauer99 model. The revised model described here reduced prediction uncertainty for these same data sets by roughly half.},

	abstract = {Nonphotic entrainment of an overt sleep-wake rhythm and a circadian pacemaker-driving temperature/melatonin rhythm suggests existence of feedback mechanisms in the human circadian system. In this study, the authors constructed a phase dynamics model that consisted of two oscillators driving temperature/melatonin and sleep-wake rhythms, and an additional oscillator generating an overt sleep-wake rhythm. The feedback mechanism was implemented by modifying couplings between the constituent oscillators according to the history of correlations between them. The model successfully simulated the behavior of human circadian rhythms in response to forced rest-activity schedules under free-run situations: the sleep-wake rhythm is reentrained with the circadian pacemaker after release from the schedule, there is a critical period for the schedule to fully entrain the sleep-wake rhythm, and the forced rest-activity schedule can entrain the circadian pacemaker with the aid of exercise. The behavior of human circadian rhythms was reproduced with variations in only a few model parameters. Because conventional models are unable to reproduce the experimental results concerned here, it was suggested that the feedback mechanisms included in this model underlie nonphotic entrainment of human circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {Jet lag arises from a misalignment of circadian biological timing with the timing of human activity, and is caused by rapid transmeridian travel. Jet lag's symptoms, such as depressed cognitive alertness, also arise from work and social schedules misaligned with the timing of the circadian clock. Using experimentally validated mathematical models, we develop a new methodology to find mathematically optimal schedules of light exposure and avoidance for rapidly re-entraining the human circadian system. In simulations, our schedules are found to significantly outperform other recently proposed schedules. Moreover, our schedules appear to be significantly more robust to both noise in light and to inter-individual variations in endogenous circadian period than other proposed schedules. By comparing the optimal schedules for thousands of different situations, and by using general mathematical arguments, we are also able to translate our findings into general principles of optimal circadian re-entrainment. These principles include: 1) a class of schedules where circadian amplitude is only slightly perturbed, optimal for dim light and for small shifts 2) another class of schedules where shifting occurs along the shortest path in phase-space, optimal for bright light and for large shifts 3) the determination that short light pulses are less effective than sustained light if the goal is to re-entrain quickly, and 4) the determination that length of daytime should be significantly shorter when delaying the clock than when advancing it.},

	abstract = {Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A1 receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A1 receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model’s ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules.},

	abstract = {A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as ﬁring rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and ﬁring rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes ‘‘ﬂip-ﬂop’’ behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distinguishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.},
