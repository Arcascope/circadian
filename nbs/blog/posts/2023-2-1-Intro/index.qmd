# Introduction 

Actograms are a powerful way to visualize trends in behavior and physiological markers. They and commony used in circadian research to visualize trends in sleep and activity. They take a minute to learn how to read them but once you do, they are a powerful tool.

In @fig-actogram we show an actogram of my steps recorded by an apple watch over 500 days. The vertical axis shows the days **increasing** down the axis. The horizontal axis shows the time of day, or traditionally the "ZT" or [zeitgeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber) time. In this case it really shows the time of day in hours since midnight. The dark areas show times when the steps where below a threshold, these are inactive periods. The white areas show periods where I was active. 


```{python}
#| label: fig-actogram
#| fig-cap: "An actogram of my steps over 500 days"

import circadian 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from circadian.plots import Actogram 
from circadian.readers import read_standard_json 
cpath = circadian.__path__[0]
# Read in the data
wdata = read_standard_json(cpath + '/sample_data/sample_data.json')

# -6.0 is to shift the time to the correct timezone from the UTC timezone of the data
Actogram(wdata.time_total - 6.0, light_vals=wdata.steps);
```

```{python}
